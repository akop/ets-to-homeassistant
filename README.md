# ETS project file to Home Assistant configuration

A Ruby script to convert an ETS5 project file (`*.knxproj`) into:

* a YAML configuration file suitable for Home Assistant (requires to define the building and functions in ETS)
* an XML file for `linknx` (the object list only)

[https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/knx/](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/knx/)

## Important note

Actionable entities in KNX are "Group Addresses" (GA).
For example a dimmable light has a group address for On/Off and another for the dimmig value.

In Home Assistant (HA), actionable entities are devices.
For example, a dimmable light is a device and has properties, one of them is the group address for On/Off and another for the dimming value.

By default, and in fact in a lot of ETS projects, only group addresses are defined as this is sufficient for an installation.
So **there is no standard way** of collating several GA into devices usable by Home Assistant.

This tool provides two ways in order to generate Home Assistant devices with related Group Addresses:

* Either define **Functions** using the ETS software: refer to [Structure in ETS](#structure-in-ets)
* Or create a custom Ruby function that is able to detect GAs that are part of the same device: refer to [Custom method](#custom-method)

## Installation

[Install Ruby for your platform](https://www.ruby-lang.org/fr/downloads/):

* Linux: builtin (yum, apt), or [RVM](https://rvm.io/), or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
* macOS: builtin, or [RVM](https://rvm.io/), or [brew](https://brew.sh/), or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
* Windows: [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/)

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laurent-martin/ets-to-homeassistant.git
````

Install required gems (`xml-simple`, `rubyzip`):

```bash
cd ets-to-homeassistant

gem install bundler

bundle install
```

## Usage

Once Ruby is installed and this repo cloned, change directory to the main folder and execute `./ets_to_hass.rb`:

The general invokation syntax:

```bash
Usage: ./ets_to_hass.rb [--format format] [--lambda lambda] [--addr addr] [--trace trace] [--ha-knx] [--full-name] <etsprojectfile>.knxproj

-h, --help:
	show help

--format [format]:
	one of homeass|linknx

--lambda [lambda]:
	file with lambda

--addr [addr]:
	one of Free, TwoLevel, ThreeLevel

--trace [trace]:
	one of debug, info, warn, error

--ha-knx:
	include level knx in ouput file

--full-name:
	add room name in object name
```

For example to generate the home assistant KNX configuration from the exported ETS project: `myexport.knxproj`

```bash
./ets_to_hass.rb --format homeass myexport.knxproj > ha.yaml
./ets_to_hass.rb --format homeass --trace debug myexport.knxproj > ha.yaml
```

Option `--ha-knx` adds the dictionary key `knx` in the generated Home Assistant configuration.
Else, typically, include the generated entities in a separate file like this:

```yaml
knx: !include config_knx.yaml
```

The special processing lambda is `default_custom.rb` if none is provided.
It will generate basic Objects/Functions for group addresses not part of a function.

The generated result is displayed on terminal (STDOUT), so to store in a file, redirect using `>`.

Logs are sent to STDERR.

## Internal logic

The script takes the exported file from ETS with extension: `knxproj`.
This file is a zip with several XML files in it.
The script parses the first project file found.
It extracts group address information, as well as Building information.
Make sure that the project file is not password protected.

Once the project file has been parsed, an object of type: `ConfigurationImporter` is created.
Then, The custom method is called.

The property `data` of the object contains the project data and is structured like this:

```ruby
{
 ga:{
  _gaid_ => {
   name:             "from ETS",
   description:      "from ETS",
   address:          group address as string. e.g. "x/y/z" depending on project style,
   datapoint:        datapoint type as string "x.00y",
   objs:             [list of _obid_ using this group address],
   custom:           {custom values set by lambda: ha_address_type, linknx_disp_name }                                            # 
  },...
 },
 ob:{
  _obid_ => {
   name:   "from ETS",
   type:   "object type, see below",
   floor:  "from ETS",
   room:   "from ETS",
   ga:     [list of _gaid_ included in this object],
   custom: {custom values set by lambda: ha_init, ha_type}
  },...
 }
}
```

`ga` contains all Group addresses, `_gaid_` is the internal identifier of the group address in ETS

`ob` contains all ETS **Functions**, `_obid_` is the internal identifier of the function in ETS

## Structure in ETS

Building **functions** are used to generate HA devices.
If the ETS project has no building information, then the script will create one device per group address.

In the following screenshot, note that both group addresses and building **Functions** are created.

![ETS 5 with building functions](images/ets5.png)

Moreover, if the functions are located properly in building levels and rooms, the script will read this information.

When ETS **Functions** are found, the script will populate the `ob` Hash.

**object type** are functions defined by ETS:

* `:custom`
* `:switchable_light`
* `:dimmable_light`
* `:sun_protection`
* `:heating_radiator`
* `:heating_floor`
* `:heating_switching_variable`
* `:heating_continuous_variable`

### Custom functions with HA device type tag

You can define custom functions in ETS with the HA device type tag in the name:

    "<custom function name> |<ha device type>"

For example to map to a [switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/knx/#switch) you have to use this custom function name:

    "my switch name |switch"

The \|switch will be removed from the name.

### Group addresses with HA object type tag

For example :dimmable_light and :sun_protection have two group addresses with the same datatype and can't be automatically mapped.

You can add a tag to the group address name to define their HA object type:

    "custom group address name |<ha object type>"

For example to map a light device addresses to brightness_address and brightness_state_address:

    "light kitchen |brightness_address"
    "light kitchen |brightness_state_address"

For the other group addresses of light kitchen the tags are not necessary and optional.

### group addresses with boolean flags

Cover invert_position if there is invert_position in the ga name it will be set to true.

## Custom method

If No building with **Functions** was created in the project, then the tool cannot guess which set of Group Addresses refer to the same HA device.

It is possible to add this information using the third argument (script) which can add missing information, based, for example, on group address name.

The optional post-processing function can modify the analyzed structure:

* It can delete objects, or create objects.
* It can add fields in the `:custom` properties:

  * `ha_init` : initialize the HA object with some values
  * `ha_type` : force the entity type in HA
  * `ha_address_type` : define the use for the group address
  * `linknx_disp_name` : set the description of group address in `linknx`

The function can use any information such as fields of the object, or description or name of group address for that.

The function is called with the `ConfigurationImporter` as argument, from which property `data` is used.

Typically, the name of group addresses can be used if a specific naming convention was used.
Or, if group addresses were defined using a specific convention: for example in a/b/c a is the type of action, b is the identifier of device...

## Linknx

`linknx` does not have an object concept, and needs only group addresses.

## XKNX

Support is dropped for the moment, until needed, but it is close enough to HA.

## Reporting issues

Include the version of ETS used and logs.
